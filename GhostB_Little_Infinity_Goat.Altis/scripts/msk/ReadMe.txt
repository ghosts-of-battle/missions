Helicopter-door-opening-script by Delta8.
Version 0.2.6 (Beta)

Thanks to marker for English, syncie for Dutch, NorX_Aengell and ussmarines for French, Shuravi_rnd for Russian, RabsRincon for Spanish and Fr3eMan for Italian translation!
Thanks to 14.JgKp for MP-testing (especially Ben@Arms)

The script is MP-friendly but has a great time-Problem in loading (v.0.1).
I hope, I managed to fix that issue. So please give me feedback!

You may use it at your own risk.


To use the script in your mission, simply put it in your mission-folder and type the following syntax in your init.sqf:
'0 = execVM "scripts\msk\[MSK]_HD.sqf";'
Remember: the 'stringtable.xml' has to be into your missions root folder! (I packed a second stringtable.xml into the script folder if you accidentally lost the first one!)


Future Plans:
- Remove bugs (so please report them to me!)
- Helicopters, that spawn later in mission won't get the actions. I promise to work on it!
- Add further translations into 'stringtable.xml' (Translators are welcome!).
- Add the "fire-from-vehicle-ability" to passengers while the doors are open. (if possible!)
- Make a Mod-Version

Have fun trying it!

For the Modders: When taking the script in complete or snippets of it for your own scripts/modifikations, I would be happy to be asked beforehand!
