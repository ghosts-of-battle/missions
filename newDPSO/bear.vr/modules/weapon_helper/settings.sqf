...into a randomized, kitted-out insurgent force. Basically, you can throw a disorganized array of weapons, magazines, and weapon accessories, and it will select a random weapon, accessories that work with that weapon, and fill any remaining inventory space with magazines for the weapon.

This is meant to be inserted into the gearscript as-is, after all other items have been added to the loadout.

A very basic example is:

[_unit, _type, 5, ["rhs_weap_akm"]] call FNC_WepHelper;

This will add an AKM and fill the unit's inventory space with up to 5 magazines for the AKM, randomly selected from all the AKM magazines available.

A more reasonable example is:

[_unit, _type, 9, ["rhs_weap_akm", "rhs_weap_akms", "rhs_acc_dtkakm", "rhs_30Rnd_762x39mm_bakelite", "rhs_30Rnd_762x39mm"]] call FNC_WepHelper;

This will add an AKM or AKMS, the DTK muzzle attachment, and fill the unit's remaining inventory space with a random selection of up to 9 bakelite and normal magazines.

The initial example would be for an insurgent force, and is intended to provide a wide variety of randomized weapons with little effort and mag counting.
